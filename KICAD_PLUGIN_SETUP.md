# 🚀 KiCad Plugin Manager Setup Guide

The "download too big" error occurs because KiCad Plugin Manager has size limits. Here's how to fix it:

## 📦 Solution: Minimal Plugin Package

I've created a minimal plugin package (`smart_cat_plugin.zip`) that contains only essential files:

- **Original repository**: ~2-3 MB (too big)
- **Minimal package**: 44.6 KB ✅ (perfect size!)

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Release

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/BWolf-16/Smart-Cat
2. **Click**: "Releases" → "Create a new release"
3. **Tag version**: `v1.0.0`
4. **Release title**: `Smart Cat AI Assistant v1.0.0`
5. **Upload the file**: `smart_cat_plugin.zip` (created by the script)
6. **Publish release**

### Step 2: Verify the Download URL

After creating the release, the download URL should be:
```
https://github.com/BWolf-16/Smart-Cat/releases/download/v1.0.0/smart_cat_plugin.zip
```

### Step 3: Use in KiCad Plugin Manager

Now you can use these links in KiCad:

**Repository URL:**
```
https://github.com/BWolf-16/Smart-Cat
```

**Or direct metadata URL:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BWolf-16/Smart-Cat/main/metadata.json
```

## 📋 Package Details

- **Compressed Size**: 44.6 KB (well under KiCad limits)
- **Uncompressed Size**: 176.4 KB
- **Compression Ratio**: 74.7%
- **SHA256**: `5bbb07de7bf6d0d95886469499be1788c9ba4947d03c191c64ed38640228e232`

## 🎯 What's Included in Minimal Package

**Essential Plugin Files:**
- `__init__.py` - Plugin registration
- `main.py` - Main plugin class
- `ui.py` - User interface
- `AI_API.py` - AI integration
- `config.py` - Configuration
- `enhanced_parser.py` - PCB parsing
- `kicad_operations.py` - KiCad operations
- `circuit_generator.py` - Circuit generation
- `permissions.py` - Permission handling
- `parser.py` - Base parser
- `resources/` - Icons and assets

**Excluded (to reduce size):**
- Documentation files
- Setup scripts

## 🔄 Alternative: Direct Installation

If you still prefer direct installation without Plugin Manager:

```powershell
# Quick install from repository
curl -o setup.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BWolf-16/Smart-Cat/main/setup.py
python setup.py install-repo
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**If Plugin Manager still shows "too big":**
1. Double-check the GitHub release was created correctly
2. Verify the download URL is accessible
3. Try refreshing KiCad Plugin Manager
4. Use direct installation method as backup
