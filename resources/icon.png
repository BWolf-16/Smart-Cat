# Placeholder icon file
# In a real implementation, this would be a PNG image file
# For now, this serves as a placeholder

# To create an actual icon:
# 1. Create a 24x24 or 32x32 pixel PNG image
# 2. Use a robot or AI-themed icon design
# 3. Save as icon.png in this directory
# 4. The main.py file will reference this icon
