   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/kicad/7.0/scripting/plugins/`
   - **Linux**: `~/.local/share/kicad/7.0/scripting/plugins/`

2. **Restart KiCad**: Close and reopen KiCad PCB Editor

3. **Verify Installation**: Look for "KiCat AI Assistant" in the Tools menu or plugin toolbar

### Method 2: Plugin Manager (if available)

1. Open KiCad Plugin and Content Manager
2. Search for "KiCat AI Assistant"
3. Click Install

## Setup

### First Time Configuration

1. **Launch the Plugin**: Click the KiCat AI Assistant button in KiCad's toolbar
2. **Open Settings**: Click the gear (‚öô) icon in the assistant window
3. **Configure API**:
   - Select your preferred API provider (Claude, OpenAI, or Custom)
   - Enter your API key
   - Choose a model
   - For custom providers, set the base URL
   - Click "Test API Connection" to verify
4. **Save Settings**: Click "Save" to store your configuration

### API Keys

You'll need an API key from one of these providers:

**Claude (Anthropic)**:
- Sign up at https://console.anthropic.com
- Generate an API key (starts with `sk-ant-`)
- Recommended models: `claude-3-sonnet-20240229` (balanced), `claude-3-opus-20240229` (advanced)

**OpenAI**:
- Sign up at https://platform.openai.com
- Generate an API key (starts with `sk-`)
- Recommended models: `gpt-4-turbo-preview`, `gpt-4`

**Custom OpenAI-Compatible APIs**:
- Many providers offer OpenAI-compatible endpoints (e.g., local LLMs, hosted services)
- Set the base URL to your provider's endpoint
- Use the appropriate API key format for your provider
- Common examples: Ollama, LM Studio, Together AI, Replicate

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Open a PCB or Schematic** in KiCad
2. **Launch KiCat AI Assistant** from the toolbar
3. **Ask Questions** like:
   - "Analyze my current PCB design"
   - "What potential issues do you see with component placement?"
   - "How can I improve signal integrity?"
   - "Review my power distribution"
   - "Check for EMI considerations"

### Context Detection

The assistant automatically detects:
- **PCB Context**: Components, nets, traces, vias, board dimensions, layer count
- **Design Rules**: Track widths, via sizes, clearances
- **DRC Information**: Design rule violations (if enabled)

### Example Questions

**Design Analysis**:
- "What do you think of my component placement?"
- "Are there any potential signal integrity issues?"
- "How can I optimize my routing?"

**Specific Reviews**:
- "Check my power supply section"
- "Review the high-speed signals"
- "Analyze thermal considerations"

**Learning & Improvement**:
- "Explain why this layout might cause EMI"
- "What are best practices for this type of circuit?"
- "How can I reduce crosstalk?"

## Configuration Options

### API Settings
- **Provider**: Choose between Claude, OpenAI, or Custom
- **API Key**: Your personal API key
- **Model**: Select specific AI model
- **Base URL**: Custom API endpoints (for OpenAI-compatible services)

### Advanced Settings
- **Max Tokens**: Response length limit (100-8192)
- **Temperature**: Creativity level (0-100%)
- **Chat History**: Number of messages to retain (10-200)
- **Auto Context**: Automatically include design context
- **Include DRC**: Add design rule check information
